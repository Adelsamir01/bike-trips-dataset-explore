## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 175,000 bike trips, including
duration, member details, and other trip information such as logistics. 
The dataset can be found in the following: https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there is weak realtionship betwwen the duration
of the trip and other numerical variables. Thus, the data were more refined and a focus
group were selected and outliers were removed. However, these is a no high corrlation between
the duration of the trip and the age of the user or any other quantitavie variables.

However, there are some interesting findings when it comes to the categorical 
variables as following:
Majority of males tend to subscribe
Customers are not at all sharing the bikes
Majority of users tend not to use the sharing option whatever the gender


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus introducing the contents of the dataset first
then focusing visualizing the features of interest (Duration) so that you can
see the distribution on a log scale to follow easily. Then, exploring other variables that
we need to connect to the feature of interest (Age). Then, spotting on the finding that 
there are no strong correlations between the quantitative variables, letting us move the 
exploration to the categorical variables.
